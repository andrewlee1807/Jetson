                            Quick Start Guide
                             R31.1.0 Release
===========================================================================
Use these procedures to quickly get started using the NVIDIA Tegra Linux Driver
Package in conjunction with a Jetson Developer Kit.

Prerequisites
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use the Tegra Linux Driver Package, these requirements must be met:

- A Jetson Developer Kit, equipped with an NVIDIA Tegra Processor.
- A Linux host system running x86_64 Ubuntu v16.04 or v18.04.
- The Jetson Developer Kit connection as follows:
  - Power adapter plugged into the wall socket and the Jetson Developer Kit.
  - A USB-C cable connecting the Linux host system to the Jetson Developer Kit
    USB-C port located on the opposite side of power port for flashing.
  - An HDMI display device connected to the Jetson Developer Kit.
  - To connect USB peripherals such as keyboard, mouse, or USB/Ethernet
    adapter for network connection, a USB hub must be connected to the
    eSATA/USB3 port on the Jetson Developer Kit.
  - The wired Ethernet connected to install software on the Jetson
    Developer Kit after installation of Linux for Tegra (L4T).

Consult the Tegra Linux Driver Package Release Notes for board layout
information for more details.

Downloading and Installing the Release Package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow these procedures to download the latest release package.

1. Download the latest version of the L4T release package and sample
   file system for the Jetson Developer Kit available from the NVIDIA
   Embedded Developer Zone at:
   https://developer.nvidia.com/linux-tegra

2. Untar the files and assemble the root file system with these commands:

   sudo tar xpf Jetson_Linux_R31.1.0_aarch64.tbz2
   cd Linux_for_Tegra/rootfs/
   sudo tar xpf ../../Tegra_Linux_Sample-Root-Filesystem_R31.1.0_aarch64.tbz2
   cd ..
   sudo ./apply_binaries.sh

Placing the Jetson Developer Kit in Recovery Mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ensure the Linux host system is connected to the Jetson Developer Kit USB-C
   port located on the opposite side of the power port.

2. Ensure the power adapter plugged into the wall socket and the Jetson Developer Kit.

3. Power up by toggling power button.
   (The power button is the left most one of 3 buttons.)

4. Place the Jetson Developer Kit into force recovery mode as follows:
   - Press and hold the force recovery button.
     (The force recovery button is the middle one of 3 buttons.)

5. Toggle reset button.
   (The reset button is the right most one of 3 buttons.)

6. Wait two seconds and release the force recovery button.

Flashing the NVIDIA Tegra Linux Driver and Root File System onto internal
storage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to Linux_for_Tegra directory and execute this command on the Linux host system
  sudo ./flash.sh <BOARD> mmcblk0p1

  Where <BOARD> is jetson-xavier

The flashing procedure takes approximately 10 minutes or more.
Upon completion, the Jetson Developer Kit automatically reboots.
A command prompt windows opens on all the display devices attached to
the Developer Kit.

The default login credentials are:
- Username: nvidia
- Password: nvidia

For security purposes and for best practices, change the default password.

Congratulations, you have successfully setup the Jetson Developer Kit.

Installing Additional Optional Packages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use these procedures to install additional Ubuntu packages onto the Jetson
Developer Kit.

1. Make sure the Jetson Developer Kit has working Internet connection over
   the wired network.

2. Obtain the IP address as follows:
   If you are not running a graphical desktop environment that automatically
   configures your network connection, acquire an IP address with the command:

   sudo dhclient <interface>

   Where <interface> is the name of the wired ethernet adapter for the
   Wired Jetson Developer Kit. Obtain the name by executing the command:

   ip link

   The command returns eth0, enx<mac_address>, or a similar name.

3. Install the package using these commands:

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ``package-names''

   Where ``package-names'' is the list of the package names you wish
   to install.

4. Reboot the system using the command:

   sudo reboot

Consult the Release Notes for up-to-date platform and feature usage information.
